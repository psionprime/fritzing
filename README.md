# Fritzing

This is a custom library for TKI and personal public Fritzing contributions. There is no gurantee any of it will work for you. This is only for educational puposes.

* The "fixed-scaling-templates.7z" is due to the originals created via Adobe Illustrator per Jonathan Cohen using "px" and 72 dpi whereas I and others use Inkscape which is 90 dpi. Uploade a typo correction. DPI issues in a vector format tsk tsk ? ;p
